QC2 -- Advanced Quantum Chemistry Methods
=========================================

The QC2 course consists of two parts:

1. Programming: Writing a Hartree--Fock program in Fortran
2. Applications: Running typical calculations with ORCA and Turbomole

This guide is designed to help you through these two parts without requiring prior knowledge of Linux, Fortran, or quantum chemistry programs.
Start by reading the setup instructions and familiarize yourself with the Linux environment, before tackling the programming part and the applications.
