Ubuntu
------

Starting with a fresh version of `Ubuntu 18.04`_ we have to install a few programs
first.
We will assume you are working with ``apt`` to install packages, in case you
prefer another package manager, feel free to install the packages listed here
with this one (see `Ubuntu install & remove software`_).

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install gfortran make

.. _Ubuntu 18.04: http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/
