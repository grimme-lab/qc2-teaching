Quantum Chemistry Software
==========================

This section will give a short introduction and an overview of the Quantum
Chemistry programs that will be used in this practical course.

Setting up the Software
-----------------------

In order to gain access to the needed software packages, you need to
make some changes to your system. The ``.bashrc`` file located
in your home directory is sourced every time you open a new shell.
While you can directly execute any program by giving the full path,
it is more convenient to tell the system where to look for the
binaries by saving the location in the ``$PATH`` variable.
Additionally, some programs need global variables. All those
are usually set in the ``.bashrc``. In order to gain access to all the 
needed software, add the following lines to your ``.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   # AKbin
   export PATH=/home/abt-grimme/AK-bin:$PATH
   export PATH=/home/$USER/bin:$PATH

   # TURBOMOLE
   export TURBODIR=/software/turbomole702
   export PATH=$TURBODIR/scripts:$PATH
   export PATH=$TURBODIR/bin/`sysname`:$PATH

   # ORCA
   ORCABINPATH=/home/software/orca-4.0.0
   PATH=$ORCABINPATH:$PATH

   # XTB
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
   export MKL_NUM_THREADS=2
   export OMP_STACKSIZE=500m
   ulimit -s unlimited

Be sure to create a directory called ``bin`` in your home directory by typing:

.. code-block:: none

   mkdir ~/bin
.. export TURBODIR=/home/abt-grimme/TURBOMOLE.7.0.2

.. important:: All changes apply to shells opened afterwards.

If you want to apply the changes to your current shell, you 
need to run:

.. code-block:: none

   source ~/.bashrc

Program Packages
----------------

TURBOMOLE
~~~~~~~~~

To run a calculation with TURBOMOLE, you will need the following files:

- ``coord``: Molecular geometry in atomic units
- ``control``: All data required for the calculation (method, parameters, ... )
- ``basis`` (and ``auxbasis``): Basis set (and auxiliary basis set for RI)
- ``mos`` or ``alpha`` and ``beta``: Orbitals (MO-coefficients) for restricted and unrestricted treatment, respectively

To manually prepare a calculation, use ``define``. However, in this course,
we will employ a tool that automatically runs ``define`` with the proper
input: ``cefine``.

TURBOMOLE has different binaries and scripts for different jobs.
While they do not need an explicit input file when called, you should **always**
pipe the output into a file, *e.g.*:

.. code-block:: none

   ridft > ridft.out &

The most important scripts are:

- ``ridft``: DFT and HF SCF calculations with the RI-approximation
- ``dscf``:  DFT and HF SCF calculations without the RI-approximation 
- ``ricc2``: Module for correlated WF methods (MP2, CCSD(T), ...)
- ``rdgrad``, ``grad``: Calculate gradients (with and without RI)
- ``aoforce``: Calculate analytical vibrational frequencies
- ``statpt``: Coordinate/Hessian update for stationary point searches
- ``jobex``: Script for geometry optimizations 

And for visualization purposes:

- ``eiger``: Show the orbital energies and the HOMO-LUMO gap
- ``x2t``: Convert a \*.xyz file to coord
- ``t2x``: Convert a coord file to \*.xyz
- ``tm2molden``: Generate a molden input

.. important:: Each TURBOMOLE calculation needs its own directory.

``cefine``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   In this course, we will only use the current version of the below mentioned program
   called ``cefine_current``, but we will call it ``cefine`` in the following text.
   You can either type ``cefine_current`` instead everytime ``cefine`` is mentioned or
   (the recommended procedure) set up a symlink via typing the following line:

   .. code-block:: none

      ln -s /home/abt-grimme/AK-bin/cefine_current ~/bin/cefine

   Now you can type the lines given in this script as they appear.

``cefine`` is a command line tool that prepares the necessary input files
for TURBOMOLE. By default, it reads the ``coord`` file (the only file you have to
provide) in the directory where it is called. The basic command is:

.. code-block:: none

   cefine -<method> -bas <basis>

where ``<method>`` defines the type of calculation and ``<basis>``
the desired basis set.
To get an overview over the most important command line options, use

.. code-block:: none

   cefine -h

In the following exercises, the proper options will always be given
in the text. Additionally, you can find a short list of the options
in the section :ref:`Short cefine reference`.

ORCA
~~~~

ORCA needs an input file (*e.g.* ``myinput.inp``) to run. A typical call to perform a calculation with ORCA would be

.. code-block:: none

   orca myinput.inp > myinput.out &

The input file is generally structured as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   # Comment lines are marked with an '#' and are possible everywhere
   ! Method Basis and further options

   # Input is organized in blocks which start with '%'
   # e.g.
   %scf
           MaxIter 150 #maximum number of iteration steps in the scf,
                       #default = 50
   end
   # definition of input geometry 
   * xyz <charge> <multiplicity>
           cartesian coordinates (Angstroms)
   *
   or:
   * int <charge> <multiplicity>
           Z-Matrix
   or:
   * xyzfile <charge> <multiplicity> <filename.xyz>        
   *

.. important:: Multiplicity = 2S+1 with S being the total spin.

A short reference of ORCA keywords can be found in the section :ref:`Short ORCA reference`.

General Recommendations
-----------------------

1. Work on the exercises in the given successive order. In the first exercises you will learn some basic
   routines and procedures which you will need again later but which will not be explained once more.
        
2. Read the whole exercise before you start to working on it. Often technical hints are given at the end.
  
3. Programs can crash. So check your outputs as soon as possible to make sure your calculations actually did work.
   And sometimes preparing the input and running the program is much faster than finding the right number
   in the output. 
        
4. Prepare an LibreOffice sheet (or similar) with a collection of your results. Checking them this way is much easier for us.
        
Trouble shooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many programs may cause many problems, therefore you should follow some simple guidelines to identify their origins:

- "Crap in, crap out": Always check your input (input structures, file formats, input file, chosen keywords etc.) before you start a calculation.
- If a calculation stops abnormally check the output (*e.g.* orca.out, job.last etc.) and error files first. Always make sure that you pipe all needed output data into files if its not done by default.
- Read your output and error files carefully. Especially check the last lines of the output file for error messages that give a hint what may caused the problem.
- If you identified the problem (maybe you have to start at the first point again), check the program manual for additional options or trouble shooting help, fix the problem and restart your calculation.
- If the calculations still stops abnormally and all other possibilities and options are exhausted, prepare a detailed description of the problem, the output/error messages and contact one of the tutors.
